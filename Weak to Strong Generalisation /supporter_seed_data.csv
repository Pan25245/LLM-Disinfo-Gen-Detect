35709385,@labor_trash @guardian I‚Äôm going to start hash tagging #ArsonEmergency from now on. They are obviously threatened by it.
35709385,"As the Global Warming myth unravels, the Climate Change Lemmings get more shrill and more hysterical with terms such as #ClimateCrisis and #ClimateEmergency and #Extinction.

And the more they need to shut down facts.

""Got a great story on the 2013 Tasmanian fires""

""Excellent. What caused them?""

*awkward silence*

""Oh, um, negligent arson...""

""For God's sake don't say that in the article or Eileen will be tweeting #ArsonEmergency again!""

1214469449849245696,@ToomeyWright @abcnews And yet the tweet #ArsonEmergency seemed to trigger so many.   It's sad the #Facts seem to trigger the left so much.
1214469449849245696,Remember when #ArsonEmergency was triggering certain people as #Facts always do.....simpler times.  Feels like an eternity ago! https://t.co/0WdpZ9OgUf
880034429556580352,"@ProfPCDoherty @ConversationEDU Good work Peter. How many deliberately lit fires will you allow before it is an #ArsonEmergency ? 716 fires did not start naturally. 276 people responsible (so far). 55 charged for deliberate. How many is OK?

880034429556580352,"@ToomeyWright @FriendsOScience The arsonists who lite Australian bush fires to prove Climate Change, are the darlings of the Left. ABC, SBS &amp; Guardian will do anything to protect their arsonist heros by deflecting any commentary away from them. @InsidersABC @latingle @murpharoo #ArsonEmergency #bushfiresNSW"

Yet I was berated, bullied and doxed for daring to use the hashtag #ArsonEmergency because I spoke a truth that went against the #ClimateEmergency narrative and #ClimateChange causing the fires.

880034429556580352,"This year a NATURAL weather phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole has meant a hot, dry spell across the country.

Add the fuel load due to lack of hazard reduction and the 183 people facing court for starting fires. 

Natural. Gov fail. #ArsonEmergency 

NOT climate change."
880034429556580352,"There are, on average, 62,000 bushfires in Australia EVERY year. 

A 2015 satellite analysis of 113,000 fires from 1997-2009 indicates 40% of fires are deliberately lit, another 47% accidental. 

Combined, 87% are man-made.

Not climate change. #ArsonEmergency"

This must be how Simon plans to win all his Twitter polls in 2020. Sheer genius.

If you think arson doesn't exacerbate bushfires, but Hawaiian holidays do, you might be a complete prat.

880034429556580352,"Adam Bandt: ""Asked PM in #qt to account for the coal Aust exports &amp; its contribution to bushfires &amp; he dodged it""

So: coal exports cause bushfires.

In fact, the cause of the fires were, in the main, arsonists, many of whom were children.
